    "**Heart disease** or **Cardiovascular disease (CVD)** is a class of diseases that involve the heart or blood vessels. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. This is true in all areas of the world except Africa. Together CVD resulted in 17.9 million deaths (32.1%) in 2015.  Deaths, at a given age, from CVD are more common and have been increasing in much of the developing world, while rates have declined in most of the developed world since the 1970s.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in this kernel, I have conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis** or **EDA** of the heart disease dataset. **Exploratory Data Analysis** or **EDA** is a critical first step in analyzing a new dataset. The primary objective of EDA is to analyze the data for distribution, outliers and anomalies in the dataset. It enable us to direct specific testing of the hypothesis. It includes analysing the data to find the distribution of data, its main characteristics, identifying patterns and visualizations.  It also provides tools for hypothesis generation by visualizing and understanding the data through graphical representation.  \n",

    "I hope you learn and enjoy this kernel.\n",

    "EDA is generally cross-classified in two ways. First, each method is either non-graphical or graphical. Second, each method is either univariate or multivariate (usually bivariate).  The non-graphical methods provide insight into the characteristics and the distribution of the variable(s) of interest. So, non-graphical methods involve calculation of summary statistics while graphical methods include summarizing the data diagrammatically.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### i. Univariate non-graphical EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the univariate non-graphical EDA is to understand the sample distribution and also to make some initial conclusions about population distributions. Outlier detection is also a part of this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ii. Multivariate non-graphical EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "Multivariate non-graphical EDA techniques show the relationship between two or more variables in the form of either cross-tabulation or statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### iii. Univariate graphical EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to finding the various sample statistics of univariate distribution (discussed above), we also look graphically at the distribution of the sample.  The non-graphical methods are quantitative and objective. They do not give full picture of the data. Hence, we need graphical methods, which are more qualitative in nature and presents an overview of the data. \n",
